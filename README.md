# HyUI - We've moved!

We've updated the name of this project to "Hytale ReactiveUI" to reflect the functionality it offers,
a Reactive UI framework for Hytale. Visit the [new Hytale ReactiveUI repository](https://github.com/jmrapp1/Hytale-ReactiveUI) for all further updates!

Migrating is simple and a guide is offered [here](https://github.com/jmrapp1/Hytale-ReactiveUI?tab=readme-ov-file#migrating-from-old-version-hyui).
